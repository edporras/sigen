C++ Si Generation Library
=========================

To compile:

  cd sigen
  make depend
  make

To install into global include / lib paths, you should define the
variables GLOBAL_INCLUDE_PATH and GLOBAL_LIB_PATH.  For example, under
bash:

   export GLOBAL_INCLUDE_PATH="~/work/include"
   export GLOBAL_LIB_PATH="~/work/lib"

Then, install with the command:

  make install

This will take care of creating a directory named "sigen" in the
include path and copying the necessary headers into it.  Then it will
copy libsigen.a into the lib path.  You should use these global ones
to compile and link against instead of the library's work source
directory.


Compile Options
===============

Edit the Makefile and define the following to enable / disable the
feature:

  -DENABLE_DUMP: forces inclusion of methods and functions for outputing
  table / descriptor dump data to a c++ ostream.  All table / descriptor
  classes are defined with a dump(ostream&) method for this purpose.  For
  debugging, etc. to stdout, use the DUMP() macro defined in dump.h which
  is included only when this feature is enabled (calls to dump data are
  not compiled otherwise).

  Of course, you can choose to dump to a file by passing an ofstream as
  the argument to the dump methods.

  -DTRACE: internal debug macro.  You shouldn't need to use this unless
  you're curious or, worse yet, bored. :)
